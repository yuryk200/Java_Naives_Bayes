This project was to build a predictive/classification machine learning model using Naive Bayes algorithm.

The machine learning model is used to predict whether a secondary school student student will become an entrepreneur or not in the future based on the data from pervious secondary school students and whether they became entrepreneurs (Stored in MLdata files) or not and other data relevant to this such as gender, studied business subjects, had part time job etc (all shown in MLdata).

The model is built in JAVA and uses a GUI to show the results of the model.
